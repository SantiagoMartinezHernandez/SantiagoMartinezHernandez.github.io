I'm an undergraduate student of biomedical and software engineering with a
minor in neuroscience at the University of the Andes on Colombia.

I'm quite passionate on the fields of artificial intelligence, neuroscience,
robotics, biology, pluripotential cells, and complex systems.

Throughout the years I have worked with the most wonderful teams,
feel free to check them out, along with the projects, at the projects section.

I wish to put the knowledge that I have gathered to the service of human
health; It is my great pursue in live to understand the underlying
mechanisms of aging on the epigenomic landscape, and even find ways to reverse
it!
