As part of my job at the <a href="https://ingbiomedica.uniandes.edu.co/es/investigacion/lineas-investigacion/biologia-matematica-computacional">mathematical and computational biology group
(BIOMAC) </a>
 at the university of los Andes, I was put to the task of creating
a thematic clustering for literature research before writing a proposal for the
use of the <a href="https://ingbiomedica.uniandes.edu.co/es/noticias/harmonize">Harmonize project </a> data for the prediction of Dengue spreads over developing zones of Colombia.

Being both lazy and competent on data science, I said to my PI "Hey, why don't
we automate this task?" He, having a background in computational biology, thought
it be a wonderful idea. And so, here we are! An automated thematic clustering using natural language
processing, web scrapping, and elemental graph theory on Python!

<h3> Objective </h3>

Although the goal of the project is specific to a single type of databases
provided by the colombian government, I hope to develop an algorithm capable
of generalization. With these conditions set, the objective may be the following

To create an algorithm powered by NLP and WS capable of extracting semantic
information, clustering, fabrication of dendrograms, and a adjacency matrix for
graph implementation.

<h3> Development </h3>

Until I have a MVP, the code will remain private; but if you wish to contribute
I'll be more than glad to give you access. Progress would be posted on this
page constantly.
